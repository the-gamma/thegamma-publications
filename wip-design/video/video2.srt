00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,820
Exploring data in a programming environment that shows the source code, increases transparency,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:14,400
reproducibility and empowers users to ask critical questions. But can we make those features accessible to non-programmers?

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
The Gamma is a simple text based data exploration environment that allows

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,730
non-experts to explore data from a wide range of data sources using iterative prompting

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,140
a simple, easy to learn interactional principle. Using iterative prompting data,

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,610
analysts can construct complete data exploration scripts by repeatedly selecting one of several offered options from an auto-complete list.

7
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:47,520
Iterative prompting turns auto-complete from a programmer assistance tool into an end-user programming mechanism.

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,180
It can be used to access a wide range of data sources in a uniform way.

9
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:03,730
This includes querying tabular data, retrieving data from data cubes and exploring the structure of graph databases.

10
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,280
Iterative prompting lowers the barrier to entry for programmatic data exploration.

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:19,510
In a study evaluating the first experience of using the Gamma, 12 out of 13 non-programmers completed a non-trivial data exploration task,

12
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:25,880
half of them without any assistance. To quote a participant from our study,

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,160
"For somebody who does not do coding or programming, this does not feel that daunting."
