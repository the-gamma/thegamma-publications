Exploring data in a programming environment that keeps the
full source code increases transparency, reproducibility
and empowers users to ask critical questions.

But can we make those features accessible to non-programmers?

The Gamma is a simple text based data exploration environment
that allows non-experts to explore data from a wide range of
data sources using iterative prompting, a single easy to learn
interaction principle.

Using iterative prompting, data analysts can construct
complete scripts exploring data by repeatedly selecting one
of the offered options from an auto-compete list.

Iterative prompting turns the auto-complete mechanism from
a programmer assistance tool into an end-user programming
mechanism. It can be used to access a wide range of data sources
in a uniform way. This includes querying tabular data, retrieving
data from data cubes and exploring the structure of graph databases.

Iterative prompting lowers the barrier to programmatic data
exploration. In a study evaluating the first experience of using
The Gamma, 12 out of 13 non-programmers completed a non-trivial
data exploration task, half of them without any assistance.

To quote a participant from our study, 
"For somebody who does not do coding or programming, this
does not feel that daunting."
