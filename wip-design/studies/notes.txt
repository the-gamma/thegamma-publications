FIRST: How one area transfers to another?


DEMO: WorldBank
explain everything

DISPLAY: Public order and safety, Defence
\begin{verbatim}
expenditure.byService.'Public order and safety'.inTermsOf.GDP
expenditure.byService.Defence.inTermsOf.GDP
\end{verbatim}

DEMO: Graph DB
explain everything

\begin{verbatim}
drWho.Character.Doctor.'ENEMY_OF'.'[any]'
  .'APPEARED_IN'.'[any]'.'explore_properties'.explore
  .'group data'.'by 1-name'.'count distinct 2-title'
\end{verbatim}

DISPLAY: Who has larges travel expenses?
(and in London only?)

\begin{verbatim}
lords.'sort data'.'by Travel Costs descending'

lords
  .'filter data'.'County is'.London.then
  .'sort data'.'by Travel Costs descending'
\end{verbatim}

SECOND: No experts are needed

DEMO: explain how live preview works, explain how '.' works,
explain how newlines and indentation work

DISPLAY 'CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita)'

\begin{verbatim}
worldbank.byCountry.'United Kingdom'
  .'Economy & Growth'.'GDP per capita (current US$)'

worldbank.byCountry.Germany
  .'Economy & Growth'.'GDP per capita (current US$)'

worldbank.byCountry.'Czech Republic'
  .'Economy & Growth'.'GDP per capita (current US$)'
\end{verbatim}


DISPLAY: Top athletes from London

\begin{verbatim}
olympics
  .'group data'.'by Team'.'sum Gold'.then
  .'sort data'.'by Gold descending'.then
  .paging.take(5)
  .'get series'.'with key Team'.'and value Gold'
\end{verbatim}


THIRD: 'then'

DEMO: Show worldbank
GIVE: Commented source code using 'olympics'
DISPLAY: Top athletes from London (think-aloud)

QUESTIONS

1) Did I tell you enough in the introduction to get started?

Say we want to provide educational materials for journalists
(with limited budgets), what would be the most important?

2) Video or just code samples?

We'll have more data sources than we can write tutorials for

3) Do we just teach them how the environment works?

4) What do we need to teach about a data source?

"i haven't done 'then' "

USABILITY ISSUES
- need to delete the rest of the line
- when you leave ".c" there, things break
- typing . without indentation does not work
- purple box vs. black wrench icons in the completion
- how do you know top level data sources
- 'games is' bit (with the year) - methods suck!

% ==================================================================================================

TODO: How many people actually finish the tasks?

~1 KK - expenditure - finished partly (one data source, not the other)
~2 AG - expenditure - finished (and did some more exploration)
~3 HM - expenditure - finished (and did some more exploration)
~4 KR - expenditure - finished with minor hint (do not use by Year)
~5 BM - expenditure - finished (and did some more exploration)
~6 AW - worldbank - figured it out (with minor syntax hint about '.c')
~7 SL - worldbank - figured it out fine
8 MB - worldbank - figured it out (maybe needed minor hint?)
~9 AR - lords - figured it out (after some struggling)
~10 KP - lords - figured it out (quickly)
~11 GK - lords - figured it out with some help (not filter using method)
12 PF - olympics - finished with minor hint (methods)
~13 RN - olympics - finished with minor hint (methods)



data scientist (PF)
  * confused by methods ('Year is'.2012, 'Games contains'.2012 before 'Games is'.'London (2012)')
  * it's more powerful than SQL because "i don't need to keep in my head the members because it's giving me context" (~11min)
  * what is then: "allows us to chain together the operations"
    is it special? "maybe I need it just to split over multiple lines" (experiments..) "no!" (~14min)
  * what educational material?
  * didn't know whether to indent it - "is it useful to show a video? maybe for one, you don't need it for everything" [every data source]


business team 1 (KK, AG, HM, KR, BM) -- expenditure (transfer from worldbank)
  - people can find what they are looking for if they know what they are looking for
  - everyone who managed it continued to explore further (other things that government spends on such as education)
  - most poeple type to use the search in auto-complete
  - triggered discussion about misleading data visualizations

  * KK - tried various different things
  * AG - confused by indentation (Monaco inserts it automatically - duh!), it does not work if you have it and add a new to-level thing;
    continued to explore other areas of government spending independently
  * KR - tries to get data for individual years (to compare data over multiple years)
    -> maybe we need to help with some sort of 'what you migth get prediction'
  * BM - perfect; uses copy & paste to copy thing and replace one identifier in the middle
    (which would be difficult to do with non-textual representation)
  Discussion
  - How do you get comparison (KR) between multiple different years?
  "This is actually pretty simple to use. You think about the logic of what you're actually asking and
    then you try to get it into the format you can. But knowing where it comes from would tell you how
    to trust it."
  - show a tree of what your options are (= show options, commands, etc.)
  - were you able to learn from 'worldbank'?
    "it would be time expensive to produce vidoes of what is basically the same action" (~23:55)
    "once you know what's the question, you know how to get it"
    what logic do we need to teach? "how you understand the data set"
  - "ignore this, think about - because you can see all the options; think about what you want to know?
      then, get it clear in your head what you need to ask, then start with the data source, see where to go" (~25:29)
  - "I found it quite easy to translate what you showed us in the demo to the new dataset, i though it was quite easy to just get how that works" (~27:12)
  - HM: it was good to just play around with it

  - "you could use it as a training resource .. you could say 'here's data, tell a story'
    you could ask them to present a story - austerity is terrible or opposite
    (..) present different perspectives on data [training nationally]" (~33:50)
  - would students get this? "I don't think they'd need more than 5 minute video. This is a data
    source, this is what's in there."

business team 2 (AR, KP, GK) -- lords, transfer from drWho
  - it is hard to understand what operations are (get the data, group data, filter data)
  - people occasionally miss '.' when typing and try to use a space
  - people try typing "by" even for e.g. filtering
  - not many (1/3) people try exploring independenntly afterwards

  - AR figured it out eventually (help - don't need 'get the data')
  - KP figured it out quickly
  - GK spent a lot of time figuring out that 'then' is needed

  - "having an example was helpful, you kind of know what the end goal is"
  - "when you explained about the "dot then" that was a really useful thing to know. When I found that, I was like 'this is fine, this is doable'. If I knew this from the start, it would [have been easier]" (~27)
  - "keystroke by keystroke video would be good"
  - "the interface itself is clear and easy to use, but you have to be able to understand the concepts" - "it is quite different than excel; you want to click on columns"
  - "dr who was a very accessible example, journalists will know their specialist areas; it's quite a good ... for understanding it and they can then use it for more complex ..." (~31)
  - how do you sort to find county? then i realised i need to filter - general intro to sort, filter, etc. - once I understood that, I was okay (~32)
  - "i quite liked those little commends 'this code is good!'" (~35)
  - "for somebody who does not do coding or programming, this does not feel that daunting. it's not like you're giving me large screen full of code, which is reassurring" (~36)


business team 3 (AW, MB, SL)
  - AW - completed, but text was not helping (need to keep it syntax correct somewhat)
  - MB - completed towards the end?
  - SL - completed quickly, some whitespace issues

  - "a video would just be this [code samples] anyway" (~19)
  - "i don't think it was hard per se; you have to be precise. it feels like this is really a powerful tool" (~26)
  - detailed error messages are rubbish

former journalist (RN)
  (including a bit of data journalism work)
  * how do I start? it's just a text editor...
  * confused by indentation: need a space before the dot
  * confused by methods ('Year is in range' tries 'Year is in range 2012')
  * forgot 'then' at the end of group data (when copying example)

  * Do you think this is something journalists could figure out how to use?
    "Yeah, I think so. There's a lot of effort going into data journalism that programming could make much quicker,
    but I was always nervous about code." ... "Something like this would really simplify things."
    "If they had a clear idea of what they're looking for and had access to the right data set, [Journalists] would find it quite easy to use." (~21:53)
  * Stuck on 'Games is' bit
  * If I had in front of me all the options, that would be helpful (22:53)
  * "Getting the final table was very easy, so I think it's good. I would definitely use it as a journalist."

  * we have more data sources (e.g. worldbank) - what kind of info do we need to give people?
    "more than one example of code would be useful because I'd be less confused about options" (27:16)
    "I think providing one video of one example is good and maybe a couple of little examples of code wher people can see the kind of things you can do" (28:02)

  * then - what does it do?
    "I thought 'then' starts a new line. (...) I realised there was no 'then' after the 'paging' command. "
    "It starts a new line or a new query? I assumed there would be one after 'paging' too."

PROBLEMS NOT SOLVED
 - data sources
 - chart labels
 - where's the data come from?
 - how to embed it, integrate in CMS - download as Excel

FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS
 - something around how hesitant people are about code
